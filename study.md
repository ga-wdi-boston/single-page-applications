# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- It is a single page of HTML that responds to user interaction w/o reloading
a new page of HTML every time. -->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- Most users think of one page as a static view and assume they view that
they've navigated to a new page when the view changes at all. -->
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- A view is the added HTML/changes that occur in a SPA when the user interacts
with the application. -->
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
<!-- The biggest one is that page does not need to reload everytime the user
interacts with out app.  Additionally the sepration of concerns achived
by having the front/back ends totally apparte makes transitioning models
on either front/back end easier b/c it does not impact the other.->
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
<!-- JSON, AJAX, HTML , CSS, JQUERY, JAVASCRIT-->
```
