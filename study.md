# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA is an app that makes web pages change depending on the interaction with the
user, without the need of a full page refresh.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
users mean, the single web page that the server sends to the browser when the
application starts, when they are speaking of "page". I assumed page was just the
first thing I saw when i opened up my browser or mobile app.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
The main advantage is the obvious one, the fact that pages load a lot quicker and
without the need of a full page refresh. It makes the user experience that much
smoother and simpler.

The other advantage is that SPA's send their app data as JSON. That makes it easier
for developrs to design each layer.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
ajax, json, and the dom
```
