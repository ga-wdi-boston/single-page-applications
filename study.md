# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- An SPA is a web application which is based on one HTML document.-->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- I suspect my experience is different than normal, as I've lived on the
mobile web since 2007 and have spent more time valuing
the single load of SPAs, I've defined a "page" in this way for a long time. Most users seem to associate it with anything it takes a click to find. -->
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- View State is a way of managing the current stae of a page as it is refreshed from with new information from the server, some of whose methords are view/ control state, and cookies. -->
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
<!-- SPAs can feel more like a native app, as it involves very little communication with a server, and most of the work is done client-side, which is inherently faster.  -->
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
<!-- Ember, Durandal and Angular are some commonly-used tools to create single page applications.  -->
```
