# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
It is a web app that loads a single HTML file.  It has additional views from the "main page" or shell.
it can menue items, side bars ect.
I used singlepageapp.com as a source as well as ASPET.net
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
It is what you looked at when you clicked on google search link.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
a views are "other pages" from html fragments. There can be many views on the same page.
a view-state is the "page you are currently on"
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
it does not require constant looping back to the server to retreive the html, blocking event loop.
making it faster.  With the shell it is also user friendly because the "page acts more like an application."
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
some of the tools are: AngularJS, Ember.js, Meteor.js, ExtJS.
```
