# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
From my understanding of the MSDN article, it seems that and SPA is a web format that involves a single HTML page which updates dynamically through ajax requiests and json respnses. This has a number of benefits including offloading a bunch of work on to the client side, separating the page and the logic so that the front end and back end can be modified independantly of one another, and offering a smoother end user experience which doesn't require page reloads.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
When a user says 'page', they typically mean a set view in the browser that contains content specific to that 'page'. A user typically thinks of ay significant change to the content in the browser as navigating to a new page.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
'View'is meant to mean anything being displayed on the browser at any given time. Front end routers help to connect the content on the client side, with data on the server side through ajax requests.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
A single page applications will be more modular, easier to update, and a more fluid experience for the client.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
SPA's often utalize javascript frameworks, ajax, websockets, and json. These tools combine to manage the client side application and connect it to the server side content.
```
