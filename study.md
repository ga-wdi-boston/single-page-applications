# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a single page web application. This creates an app like experience for users. One of the key features of this is that the html is only loaded once and then the interactions are done dynamically on the client side.```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Users (and myself before this lesson) think of pages as a website or landing spot whenever you type in a URL.  ```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View- everything that the user sees
View state- The distinct functionality of the current view
Front end routers allow users to switch between views.```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?
