# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

SPA is a single page application that can accept user input without refreshing the page contents.  This makes for a streamline site and allows for better performance because the page only needs to be loaded once.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Before this, I thought that a page is the screen that people see when they're on the internet and click things to make other things happen.  Each click would result in a new page.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View is what people see on the screen.  View-state is what is going on behind the scenes to make certain things happen, like when someone clicks on a piece of navigation.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
A SPA looks more like an app, the page does not need to be reloaded with every click, and they have modular more code.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
JavaScript and AJAX are typically used to create SPAs.
