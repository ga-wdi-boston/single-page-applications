# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA is an acronym for Single Page Applications. This means that the app or
website uses a single HTML template and upadates as the user interacts with the
website by relying heavily on AJAX/javascript.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Page for non-devlopers mean when a view is refreshed, and different content
appears on the screen. To me page is the same thing as the HTML that reflects it
so if there is only one HTML file, that is one page. If there are mutiple templates
or layouts then there are multiple pages.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View state is what is currently displayed on the page. Specifically in relation to the
layout/html, which is the view. The front end routers is what tells the the
brower when to go to that content view, what is displayed there. For example the
difference between logging in and changing your password would have two different
routers declared.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
SPA does not rely on the page relaoding for data to be sent, instead by the SPA
interacting with AJAX and sending the data as JSON. You can change the HTML
indenpendentally and the UI independentally as well.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
some of the frameworks used to improve fluidity and responsiveness are:
ember, angularJS, Meteor.js, ExtJS and React, These are all listed on Wiki for
doing so.
```
