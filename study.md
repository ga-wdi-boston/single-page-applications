# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Readings

-   [MSDN Single Page Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn463786.aspx) (Stop at 'Creating the Visual Studio Project')
-   [Modern Web applications overview](http://singlepageappbook.com/goal.html)
-   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)
-   [SPA and the Single Page Myth](https://johnpapa.net/pageinspa/)

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a single page application. All the elements required for the application
load on the initial page load. The site can be interactive without having to reload the page.

I used the MSDN and Wikipedia articles.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
A page to users is what loads when you type in a url into the browser and what
loads when you click an element on that page.

```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View refers to anything the user sees. Front end routers connect different views
on a single page and allow users to navigate between them.

I used the SPA and Single Page Myth article.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Advantages include not needing to reload the page after communicating with the server, making the experience better for the user, and the ability to separate the
visuals of the site(HTML) from the logic (Ajax), making it easier to modify.

I used the MSDN reading.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Javascript frameworks including Angular JS, Ember.js, and Meteor.js

Ajax - Browsers can send and recieve data automatically without interfereing
with the display of the page in the browser.

Websockets - a realtime client-server communication tool.

Server-sent event - also a client/server communication tool. The server can initiate
an event.

I used the wikipedia page.
