# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is an web app that does not reload the full page when updating information. Instead of using the multi-page style it renders a single page and access addtitional information as needed.
References "When a SPA starts, the first visible thing we notice is the initial server rendering of the shell" - https://johnpapa.net/pageinspa/, "An SPA is fully loaded in the initial page load and then page regions are replaced or updated with new page fragments loaded from the server on demand. " - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
A page would most closely relate to a view or a section of information that is displayed on a page.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
Developers can mean multiple thing when they say view. They can mean a section of information that is displayed to the client, it can be an entire displayed screen, or a page.
The view-state is information about what is currently being shown in the views. The routers provide a path to the different views that can be navigated by the clients.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
With a SPA you're passing over the initial HTML structure and you don't need to keep rendering full pages. This makes it so the client displays the information in a more app-like method and makes it easier to separate concerns while building out an application.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Some tools that are used with SPAs are Angular, Ember, AJAX, and JavaScript.
```
