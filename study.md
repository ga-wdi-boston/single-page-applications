# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
An SPA is a web application that provides users with a more fluid experience by
loading a single HTML page (or shell) and then updating that page (showing users
different views) dynamically as they interact with it (click navigation links,
menu items, etc.).

```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
I basically thought of a page as whatever I was seeing when I hit a certain URL.
If I clicked a link and it brought me somewhere new then I was looking at a new
page.  I guess most often I assumed that each new view was a new HTML page.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
I guess I'm not completely sure what the difference between view and view-state are,
but given the context, I think that "view" is really just another word for
referring to the HTML that a user would call a page.  View-state then would
basically be a way of tracking the specific view the user is seeing at a specific
point in time.  Front-end routers help manage the view-state by translating the
navigation or menu items that a user clicks into the view that should be displayed.

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
An SPA allows developers to provide a much more fluid user experience, since the
page can be updated dynamically instead of needing to be continuously reloaded.
It also provides developers with a way to separate the different layers of their
application and make them more modular and easier to update or change.

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
JavaScript Frameworks (AngularJS, Ember.js, etc.), Ajax, JSON, HTML5, among others.
