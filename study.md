# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
They are applications that use a single HTML page that updates as the user
interacts with it.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Users define pages as each individual website screen, before a new page loads
up.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
"View" for developers means looking at the files that make up a webpage, what
files are connected, and how each file does its job. "View-state" is  when
developers actually see the webpage posted up on the web. Front-end "routers"
manage view-state because you can update your page immediately without taking it
down from the web.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
SPA's are better to use because it becomes less complicated linking many HTML
pages together; having one page that updates as you go is better as the server
doesn't need to look deep to find a new page, it's already there.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Bootstrap, CSS parallax scrolling, Skrollr, Stellar.js.
```
