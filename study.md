# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA, or single-page-app, is more like a starter HTML page that updates as people use it... helps avoid reloading an entire page every time you want something and cuts it down to just reloading different 'views' of a page.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
A lot of times when non-developers say 'page' they really mean a 'view', like a screen you can access within a page... like if the real page is a building, you can look through different windows to see different rooms, and each 'room' has a view that comes out of the same page.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
When developers say "view" they mean a different aspect of or way to see a page.
A view-state is how the page controls what we're seeing... it's how the different views are linked to each other on a page.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
It's more concise, runs faster, and it's easier to navigate because every view uses the same HTML template.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Asset packaging, or code that helps organize everything to be more concise and organized.
```
