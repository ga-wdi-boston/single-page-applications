# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- A SPA is defined as a single page application. In the past, web applications would have to continuously refresh the page or send you to new pages in order to be used. A SPA only has one page of HTML but the user can interact with it.

```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- In the case of SPA, you might look at it and think the "page" is what is taking up your screen while looking at a web application. Before I understood SPA, I thought different menus and login forums of SPA's were considered different pages.

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- "View" is essentially the portion HTML is making up what the users see that they might refer to as a new page or screen.

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?
