# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a website or application that does not reload when new information is
presented from the client (that is to say that it does not
require the server to provide further information). For instance, when a user inter-
acts with the client (like signing into the app), the client will communicate
with the server to retrieve stored log-in information, but the page will never
reload. The purpose of a SPA, when implemented correctly, is to provide a more
fluid and efficient experience for the user.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Many non-developers probably refer to "page" as the single screen that they are
looking at while using an application, whether it reloads/refreshes or not. Some
may even refer to a page as an entire set of pages within an entire website. I
think I generally thought of a page as the single screen, but I never thought that
a reloaded page would be considered to be another page all together.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
The view is any other page (besides the original single page we send the server)
within an application. For instance, a retail website may have different "views"
for mens clothing, womens clothing, and the shopping cart. Views typically serve
as their own function and should be able to operate on their own when placed in
a different context.

"View-state" is when those views come into play - you can
have multiple views working side by side on one screen.

Front-end "routers" allow users to move to different views or menu items within
an application and helps store browsing history for the user.
