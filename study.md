# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a single page application. It does not refresh when input is added to the page. It uses AJAX and JSON to communicate with the server and the page is consistant. It responds to the user and does not need a new page/refresh to respond.
MSDN.```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
A page to non-developers is one web page. A link will go to the next page. If the page refreshes, it's still the same page. I meant the same thing!```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View-state is like the DOM but for data on application interactions. It's a view of the dynamics of page loading. A view is an instance of viewstate. A router helps manage view-state by providing relevant views to the developer.```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
SPAs give the user what they expect from a web page. The user expects the page to stay "there" when they interact with it and input their info/ideas. If the user was to put a review on amazon of 3 stars and the page refreshed, that would be double plus uncool.
Another advantage of SPAs is that it makes the coding more simple, or as devs prefer, "with more ease". It seperates the markup from the data and logic so it's easier to debug and revisit.```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
JSON, AJAX, HTML```
