# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
An application that is built for use on the web, to be accessed by a browser but offer a lot more interaction.  They act more like apps built excusively for your phone and computer, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, this takes away the jarring effect of page reloads all the time to provide a fluid User Experience.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Just a page you go to on the internet content, links, forms, pictures. knowing the extensive amount I've learned in my first two weeks the amount that goes on behind the scenes during development and deploymet I will never see a web page the same.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
It can store the page value at the time of post back (Sending and Receiving information from Server) of your page. This allows for faster loading as the basics and some complexity of the page are saved.

```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Single page applications load faster, are dynamic. The development is simplified and streamlined. There is no need to write code to render pages on the server.
SPAs are easy to debug with Chrome, as you can monitor network operations, investigate page elements and data associated with it.
It’s easier to make a mobile application because the developer can reuse the same backend code for web application and native mobile application.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
javascript frameworks such as Ember, Angular, AJAX, JSON, XML and many more.
```
