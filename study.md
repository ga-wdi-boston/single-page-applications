# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA swaps out sections of the page (or a single HTML page)
instead of the whole page as traditional applications do.
It is a more efficient way for user experience. It drops the
constant page reloads and will automatically update the page as the user is
interacting with it.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Users maybe think of the web page they're visiting and nothing more-- like the
display of a web app and continues to search for what they came for.
When I thought of page, I thought of web page as well but the content
that loads within the browser.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
The coding blocks of HTML dictate the views and how it is displayed when a
user is perusing the app/ site (it can be from the navigational bar, to unsubscribing,
to signing out of an account).
View-state can mean the state or status of the current view
through data.
Front-end routers help manage view-state in a way where data (different URLS) are
connected to different view states. 
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
You don't have to manually refresh the page which is great for the user. The
layout of the web app is alot better as it separates the HTML markup from AJAX
requests plus JSON responses. The layers are easily designed through this
process. You can change the entire back end without breaking the client so it
is efficient to users and coders alike.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
HTML, CSS JavaScript are retrieved with SPA.
AngularJS, Ember.js, Meteor.js and Aurelia are approaches used to create SPAs.
Ajax is another method, as well as Websockets.
```
