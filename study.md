# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A single page application is a website that is one page.  Instead of hyperlinking to other pages, it links to other spots in the page -- usually to hash locations lower in the page.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Users mean a website -- a page of a website.  For instance, even though ESPN.com has many different pages on it's website, it's home "page" is a single page of its multi-page site.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
Developers are referring to the model-view-controller when referring to the word "view".  Though I'm still not entirely sure what the MVC is, it does work on a single application page in order to interact with a server to product api - content.  
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
I think the main advantage is simplicity of design which allows developers to really make a lean, web-based data processing machine.  Instead of having to worry about design and linking between multi-pages, a SPA puts all available information of a site on a single page.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, AJAX, Backbone, Angular, Ember, Knockout, Dojo and JavaScriptMVC
```
