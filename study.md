# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
An SPA is a Single Page Application, which diminishes the role of the server and enhances
the roll of the client. The idea is that there is only one complete HTML "get" done by the
client, which is when the "page" is first loaded. This page is then only modified for
different views using other HTML fragments. This means thath the URL is never re-loaded
during UX.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
A "page" is a single view of a website. If you click a link on a nav bar to bring
you to a different place in the website, that will be a different "page".
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
Everything the user sees is a view. Nearly every website will have multiple views
and this is done by loading HTML fragment to change the look of the one and only
page. A "view-state" is simply refering to the content on a view. Routers simply
 allow users to navigate between two views at the click of a button (rather than
 between two pages in a traditional website).
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
The advantage of SPA is that it diminishes the role of the server and enhances
the roll of the client, giving a more fluid experience. The idea is that there
is only one complete HTML grab done by the client, which is when the "page" is
first loaded. This page is then only modified for different views using other
HTML fragments. This means thath the URL is never re-loaded
during UX.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Angular, Ember, Durandal
```
