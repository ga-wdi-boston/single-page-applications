# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a type of web application that loads the HTML separately from the forms and events
on the page. It creates a single visual framework that is changes by the actions of the user.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
When users say page they mean the view on screen.

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View is what users mean when they say page. View-state is the event in the SPA that the user is on. Front end routers manage view states by loading them separately from the HTML content.

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Makes code much more simple and streamlined. Allows the programer to build and test in isolated pieces without loading the entire app. Prevents the user from having to front-load the application.
