# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- SPA is a single html webpage which dynamically response to user interaction.
It does not require mutiple pages layout like traditional websites. Source ~ MDSN  -->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- A page is a section of a website. Traditional websites have a home page
that links the user to different sections/pages of a website.  -->
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- View is the current state of the webpage being displayed. The state of the
webpage changes depending on the type of events or user interaction. These  view
states are vital to a single page dynamic website. Front-end routers help manage
view-state by regulating how users navigate different view-states of a website.  -->
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
<!-- Single page applications result in faster load times and smoother user
interaction, because it does not require a full page refresh to navigate.
With the SPA and view-state model, only content that needs to be changed will
be altered on the same page. -->
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
<!-- Knockout.js and Ember.js library -->
```
