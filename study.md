# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A single page application is web application that dynamically updates the page when a user
interacts with the app.  The page does not need to reload everytime a change is made
on the page.  Instead data is sent over to the server and stored whille the web app is running.
The thoery of architecture is beyond my scope for now.  I know most predominantly use AJAX
to send JSON data back and forth, while some implement Model View Controller infrastructure.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md

What a page meant to me was the current website that the user is on at the moment.

```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
The view renders the contents of the model or data that is being presented.  It then
provides buttons and other widgets to interact with the model.  The view state is the
method used to preserve page and control between round trip exchange of information or data.  Front end routers allows
SPA's to track the location and state of users as they navigate their way around libraries.
