# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md A SPA is a single page application, where all of the updating is handled
by the client-side using Javascript, instead of loading a new page from the
server.

```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md a page is what can be seen in the browser screen without the
browser reloading again. Before reasearching I would have said a page is anything with a unique URL (www.blahblah.com/page.html) ```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md view: the current output of the SPA (what is on the screen)
view-state: what has or can change on the SPA.
The routers manipulate the HTML to change the view to different view states
when information is relayed back from, for example, AJAX requests.

```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
A single page application works more like a native app than a website, which
makes for a better user experience.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
AJAX, HTML5, AngularJS, jQuery```
