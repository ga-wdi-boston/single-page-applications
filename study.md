# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- Sources: Pro Single Page Application Development Using Backbone.js and ASP.NET
Authors: Gil Fink, Ido Flatow
ISBN: 978-1-4302-6673-0 (Print) 978-1-4302-6674-7 (Online)

SPA:It is a single page application which doesn't have major dependency on the server side. It is a single HTML page which allows the user to navigate through pages without long refreshes. -->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- A section of a web site.  -->
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- view is a section of the HTML file
The front -end routers save requests and avoids the browser from sending requests to the server when a page has been seen previously. -->
```
