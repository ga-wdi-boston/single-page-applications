# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA pages use a single page HTML doc to create a fluid page as the user interacts
with the page without refreshing. This is done with AJAX and HTML5.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
It was a single page(i.e html doc) of a website. Users will define a web page as a
single page. They would consider a single page to be basic and simple while I can
be very complex and rebust. 
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View is the observable view of a particular site. View state is the "view" that
should be displayed with a particular URL. This is very cpmplicated with a SPA
since many different views can be seen/rendered on the same URL.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Visually the page will be more fluid since there is no refreshing needed. As far
as builidng the site it will be easier because AJAX and JSON are separate
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
AJAX, Ember.js, Knowckout.js, HTML5, Backbone, Angular, Dojo, JS MVC
```
