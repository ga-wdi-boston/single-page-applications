# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
An SPA is a website that only requests one full html file from the server. it does this when the user
firsts navigates to the site. From that point the UI is handled on the client side, the client may request resouces
 from the server but the page never refreshes.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
They mean the different sections of a website. The content that fills the window.
A user would say that they've gone to a new page when they navigate to a distcint
section of the website.

I thought of a page as the whole website. Google.com was a page, Youtube.com was page.

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md

The views are the distinct sections of the website. I think a view state is the
current configuration of all the elements in the UI that the user has manipulated.

I'm not clear on what a front end router does exactly.

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional application?

```md
Much more fluid UI. The page does not refresh which makes small visual changes and animation
possible. Visually appealing
