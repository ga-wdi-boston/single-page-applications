# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a website with a single page, split out into multiple views to represent
"pages" or "screens". It uses json/ajax to update what is displayedo n screen
rather than refreshing
or actually navigating to new pages
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
A page is a new set of content. When the content changes, you are on a new "page"
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
A view is what a user might call a page. It is a representation of content. The
content can change by changing the view rather than changing the page. The URL
can contain parameters to change view states while remaining on the same page.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Great for making responsive pages that are viewable across multiple types
of devices. They can improve speed as well since the page only needs to be loaded
once
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
JSON and ajax, and various JS frameworks including Ember.
```
