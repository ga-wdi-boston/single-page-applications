# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- Single-page application is a webpage that encompasses in a single site the
calls to/from server and any interactive client-user and client-server
code/communication/tasks/activities and that reduces the back-and-forth with a server for as in
traditional sies for changes/operations and that can facilitate updates to
 the website/app.  It's interactive in that the user can save
changes and post information without having to hard-code changes
to update the site.-->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- Users mean one page that comes up in their browser when they type a url.
I mean a web page and all its funcionality when a url is typed into browser address
box. -->
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- I'm  not very sure what are meant by views, but I think it's data
associated with the current site in-view
Running out of time on this one as I need to go beyond two hours of study time
to finish this question  -->
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
<!-- Advantages include
      - not requiring back and forth from server for html,
      - represent cleaner, smarter code, avoiding repetition,
      - managed more quickly overall,
      - easier to test and change
      -->
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
<!-- Angular, Durandal, Ember, Meteor; html, css, javascript/jquery -->
```
