# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA stands for Single Page Applicaiton. The term Single Page refers to the the first page - which is loaded directly from the server. This application can render multiple subsequent pages, but those will be driven via client side, as apposed to the server side.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
traditional non-developers identify a page as somthing that is rendered upon each click / interaction on a website.

```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
"Page" can be thought of in terms of views, which are essentially html fragments that make up the the screen or page that the use sees.

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
A SPA offers a more native app like experience, allowing a web based application to feel more like a desktop applicaiton. SPA allows the application the  ability to redraw any part of the UI without needing to pull multiple server roundtrip to retrieve HTML.
