# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA is a single page applications are fluid and responsive web apps that load a single HTML page and allows the user to interact with the app while dynamically updating the page.  SPA uses AJAX, HTML, Javascript, AXAJ and JSON.

```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?


```md
Users who say "page" doesn't really know what an SPA is an assumes it's just one web page with no user
interaction that will allow you to get many different information. Before this class, I thought SPA was also one web page, like a blog.

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
"View" are HTML fragments that are considered screens. Everything that the user sees is a "view".
JavaScript routers allows developers to track user state. In addition in allows developers to load resources without reuiring a page reload.
 "View-state" is a way for the ASP.NET page framework to preserve page. It also control values between
 round trips. You can store information in view state that your code can access during the page load event the next time that the page is sent to the server.
