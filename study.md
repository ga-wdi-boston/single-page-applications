# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA is a single page application.  It means that when the first call is asked of
the server that it is sent back to the client with everything needed to run the
application.  Another complete rendering of the page is not needed.
All sources were relevant.  Quite honestly the johnpapa.net resource was the
easiest to understand in it's entirity.  But I have a feeling all the resources
will be helpful in the future.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
I thought single page was just refering to everything being on one webiste page.
Did not realize it also meant that it completely loaded the first time.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View is what is currently rendered on the page.  View state is what is initially loaded
and then subsequent views as the client does it's magic.
The router helps to manage the application state or views.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Provides a user experience similar to a desktop application.  Also does not
require subsequent round trip from UI to server to get HTML.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Ember, AngularJS, Meteor.js
```
