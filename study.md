# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- A SPA is a single page application which holds an HTML page. As far as the user is concerned all functionality is available without hitting refresh.-->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- Page means the current HTML page that is rendered.  I thought page was just the current page I am on. -->
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- View is the page rendered at the current state of data. When the model tells the view that theres been a change the view will update. The view state is what is displayed in the current shell.  If the view has been seen before the front end router will cache it and it will load faster from memory. -->
```

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md

```
