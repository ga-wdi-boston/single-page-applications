# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
  A SPA is a single page application, meaning. After the page loads, there
  won't need to be any refreshing because the interaction with the server will
  happen seemlessly through AJAX calls and JSON returns to the webpage. Once the
  user arrives at the page they will not be require to do any navagiation that
  refreshes their web browser or changes the path in the url.
  (msdn single page applications).
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
  A user says 'web page' to describe a subsection of a website.  It is usually
  used in conjuction witht the content or purpose of the page.  ie 'Home-page',
  'log-in page' and so on.  I would pretty much mean the same thing before now
  to a certain degree.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
I am still not totally clear on this but I think they are referring to what
non-developers would refer to as pages. The view is what content is currently on
the app page. So while you are still on the same page, your view state could
change from pre-login view state to logged in view state.  It is what the page
looks like based on the prior actions of the user.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
An SPA will be more fluid than a tradational application.  You won't need to
refresh the page to see changes and the page won't be re-rendering in an
intrusive way when the page refreshes in the background.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
  JSON, AJAX, HTML, CSS, Knockout.js, Ember.js and JavaScript.
```
