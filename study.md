# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- A single-page application, or SPA, is a web application or site that fits to one page. The page does not reload at all, but may appear to do so by the user because of the HTML snippets that appear based on user interaction. Data is the only thing that is sent from the server multiple times (if requested) once the page is loaded.
I used the sources provided to help me understand what a SPA is and does.-->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- A page is any new screen that is generated after submitting a request to a server. Foe example, from a Home page, selecting the About Me page to navigate to a newly rendered page called About Me.-->
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- A view is any piece of HTML that is generated but prompted to appear only after some user interaction. This HTML is sent from the server with loading of the original page, but does not appear until an action from the user causes it to.-->
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
<!-- A single-page application is more responsive and has a higher performance than the traditional application in that it does not have to send multiple requests to the server and only generates views that are prompted or needed by the client/end-user in the UI. This means that unnecessary content (or content that is not "asked for" by the user) is not in "view" until the user makes an action that asks for that content. This allows the single-application to perform with more fluiditly.-->
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
<!-- Some tools used to create SPAs include AngularJS, Ember.js, Meteor.js, ExtJS, React, Websockets, server-sent events, browser-plugins, XML, JSON and Ajax.
 -->
```
