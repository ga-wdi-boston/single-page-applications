# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
The page is everything the user see's inside of the UI. I learned that when the
content changes, it is a new page. I refered to many things as a "page" because I
thought that is was a very vague description.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
The view is what the page looks like in sections, like mapping the DOM.
The view state is the way that the page needs to stay rendered and stay together.
Front-end routers help send the information from client to server.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional application?

extra queries to download pages.

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
To create an SPA, you can have an HTML, CSS, and Javascript to be loaded dynamically
into the web page without the page reloading. It takes a few Javascript frameworks
like, AngularJS, Ember.js, and Meteor.js. It also takes Ajax and Jquery to normalize Ajax' behavior in different browsers.
