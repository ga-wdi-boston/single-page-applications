# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a web application that exists on a single web page, which manipulates
HTML and CSS elements using JS/jQuery/Ajax for a smooth user experience, rather
than sending POST requests ti the server, resulting in page refreshes.  I consulted
the first two readings for this answer.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Users usually refer to a "page" as a single URL that they stay on - that's what
thought as well.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
From what I gather, 'view' is the current status of a SPA, and view-state is related to ASP.NET.  It preserves page and control values between the client and server.  Routers can help by
saving some/all of the application state, rather than the server or client.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Does not necessitate page refreshes - behaves like a native (offline) app
State-management is performed client-side, taking pressure off of your server(s)

```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's
