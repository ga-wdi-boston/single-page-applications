# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A single page application is a web application or website that loads in a single page load.  Interacting with the elements of the application does not necessitate reloading the web page or navigating to another page.  It miirors the functinality of desktop applications and it run on the client vs the server.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
When users say a page, they are often referring to the navigating to different content on the website based on clicking or interacting with an element on a website.

Before I looked into the SPA, I also believed that page referred to just the rendered HTML,CSS. and Javascript during the initial load.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View is what is being rendered at a point in time on a website or web application.  This what the user views in the application and can interact with at a point in time.

View state are the configurations that can be rendered in a web app I think.

Routers allow users to navigate between views in the web application.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
SPA allows us to provide more robust capabilties in the client.  They allow us to design responsive sites and cut back on the request to and from the server to load pages.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Frameworks like Ember , AngularJS, Aurelia, and Meteor.JS.
Additionally, Ajax , JSON, and plugins are also used to create web applications.  A server that runs and sends server side events is also used.
```
