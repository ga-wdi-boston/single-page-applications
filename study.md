# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
It's a web application that exists in a single web page and doesn't require the user to
navigate to any other pages.  It also avoids having to refresh the page for
changes to take effect.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
I think they mean when they navigate to a website (say, espn.com), the "page" is what is
initially loaded.  Everything you can see upon completion of the initial load
is the page.  Clicking on a link would take you to a new page.  This was my
understanding of a page before I started my search.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
I believe view state is a way to manage/preserve the page as send/get requests
are exhanged between the client and the server as opposed to re-loading the entire
page.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
It's a much better experience for the user.  You avoid having to constantly re-load
the page, which could take longer and be jarring for the user.  It's a much
more fluid approach that mimics using a desktop application.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
There are Javascript frameworks like AngularJS or EmberJS.  Also, Ajax to send
and receive data asynchronously between the client and server.  JSON is the format
used for transfering the data.
```
