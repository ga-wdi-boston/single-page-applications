# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
a one-html page application.  if there is a lot happening on the page, it is due
to javascript stuff and not a bunch of page reloads.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
one view of a page.  i thought it was one load of a page
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
a view is a single page - but because that page can change without a page reload, different
users can have a different idea of what a page view is.
view-state holds the state of the page: components, field values, etc
routers - instead of taking you to a particular page - can target a state instead.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
faster - less page loading.  looks more like a desktop application
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
html, css, javascript, ajax
```
