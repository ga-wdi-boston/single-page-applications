# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a web app that loads a single page initally.  From then on each additional
"view" is controlled by client intereaction without reloading the page.  The server
responds to the client with the inital page load, and then responds to subsquent
HTTP requests for data.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
In my mind before I started to search for SPA's page ment what ever I was looking
at on the screen.  If I clicked a button or link, it brought you to a new page.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
From a developers point of reference, a view is a page.  Views are the HTML fragments
that make up each "view".  A view state allows the storing of values between views.
  A routers job is to allow the user to move from view to view by clicking menu items.
  It allows you to navigate the app without going back to the 
server.
```
