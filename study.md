# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

relevant sources you consulted in your search.

AJAX is used to retrieve info from the server, but the all visual changes
to the page happen through javscript interacting with the HTML and css.

your search to define SPAs?

```md
Page by non-developers is usually referring to a particular state of a app
or website on the screen. When I load NYT's website, the page is everything I
see when it first loads.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
View refers to what a user can see and interact. It is a
combination of the effects of all your code. Veiw-state is the current state
of the application given all the past events/data that has been altered/passed
to it.
```
