# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA, or Single Page Applications, are web applications that keep a more static state
when rendering new information for the user.  It allows the user to view many pages without
reloading the page on every click.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
For me, as a user, a page simply ment what the screen is displaying at the
present moment.  Each time I clicked something, the page would reload.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
From what I've read on the matter, when developers say "view", its not entirely
different from when users say "pages".  Views are literally the different things
seen on the page.  That could include different areas on the site or even a navigation
bar.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
SPA can be more responsive and fast because most resources only have to be loaded
once.  Resources such as: HTML, CSS, and Scripts.  Also SPA can use local storage
and caching effectively.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
AJAX, JSON, HTML, CSS, Javascript, API
```
