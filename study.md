# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA is like a... functioning web-site shell.  It allows the page to feel dynamic while
not becoming too complicated or bogged down.  It also allows pages to look, feel and act similar (because they are similar) while still allowing content to change within the boundaries of the page as needed or as requested (meaning in response to actions).

```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
I would have said that users mean a page is, a page.  A single entity.  But I'd say
now that a page can really mean the parent in a website.  Maybe not that black and white, but the elements or substance of a 'page' might contain many other pages (links, actions, etc).
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
Wow.  A lot of confusing information on this one.  People seem to have some very strong opinions on it.  Looks like view means just what it sounds like.  Looking at a web page.  View-state means....how the web page looks between loads?  Or in the state between passing/executing data?  I think.  Things like cache, cookies, java, help manage the view-states by storing data locally.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
SPAs will typically load faster and provide a more structured, similar look and feel.  They are not really compatible with search engines, though it looks like there some workarounds to that.  Loading back pages can be difficult, as the pages typically load the basecode of the SPA, but it looks like there are workarounds to that too.  Seems like, with most WEBDEV stuff, best to use SPAs when appropriate, and use something else when SPAs won't quite do or you have to keep writing in workarounds.```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Javascript, Ruby, html, other languages.  Servers play a big part in helping maintain the DOM.  I might be misunderstanding the question.  My answer would be...everything, or mostly everything can be put into SPAs, depending on how you do it.
