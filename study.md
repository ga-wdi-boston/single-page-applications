# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a web application or web site where after the first single page loads, it dynamically updates as the user interacts with it instead of refreshing.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
When users say "page" they generally mean a specific page. Even when it just changes from home page to search page, users would call that a new "page."
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
When developers say "view", it means everything the user sees. You can have many views visible on one screen. How John Papa explained it - that views are HTML fragments -- really helped make this concept clear.

The "router" allows the user to go from one view-state to another through events (e.g. clicking or scrolling).
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
A single page application makes the user experience much more pleasant, fluid, and responsive, since the page doesn't refresh over and over again in order to present new content.
For the developer, creating a single page application makes it easier to separate and design each layer.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Angular, Ember, Durandal, React, Aurelia, Backbone
```
