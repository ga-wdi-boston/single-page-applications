# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
I guess I would've consider a page to be all pages falling under a web app. For example very page under the Facebook name would've been viewed as "the facebook page"
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
views are HTML fragments that make up what the user sees. a view state is what a user sees that that moment. front end routers are what changes the HTML fragments and change the view state.
```
