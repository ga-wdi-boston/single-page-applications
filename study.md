# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- A single page web app is the result of writing an app wiht a single page of html5. It changes based on the interactions with the user and is generally has a heavy work load client side.  -->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- I was assuming no seperate pages on the website, which also pertains to the amount of language pages used to write the app. Usually they're done with a single page on html, and through ajax and javascript are able to be done so.  -->
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!--The view is what most non developers would call a page. It really just switchs the focus from one part of the app to another. It doesn't actually change page, just changes view or foucs. View state is what is in view or what part of the app is being accessed. Routers are the nagivation of what view you can get to from where. -->
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
<!-- They load faster and more fluidly compared to having to load multiple pages of html. It alows for my dynamic experiences at a faster pace.  -->
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
<!-- Javascript bundles, ajax, these both allowed the data to be loaded more fluidly and put more of the work on the client side. This allows less down time once everything has been transfered over.  -->
```
