# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA stands for single page application and it is a Web application that loads
a single page from the server and subsequent user interaction is handled on the
client side.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
When users refer to a 'page' they are describing the different screens they are
interacting with and navigating to while in the browser. That was my
definition of a page prior to learning about SPAs as well.

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
A 'view' is the term used by developers to refer to what users call a 'page'.
Views are the pages that users may navigate to and toggle between. Within SPA,
everything that is displayed in the app is a 'view'. View-state refers to the
the ability to react to user interactions in a Web app without requiring the need
to send a request to the server because it can be handled on the client side.
"Routers" manage view-state by displaying a view if it's cached so it doesn't
have to make a request to the server.

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
SPAs are more responsive than a traditional application because it doesn't
require requests to the server that would then require a page to be reloaded.
This creates a better use experience because users are able to navigate the
app more fluidly.
SPAs also creates a separation between the front end (client) and back end
(server) that allows for easier design and development without the two being
completely dependent on each other.
