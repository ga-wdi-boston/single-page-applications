# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- SPA stands for 'single page application. Which means a web page that doesn't
refresh the page when requesting information.
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn463786.aspx
-->
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- For user's a page is whatever takes up the whole screen on a browser.
Before I leanred about SPAs a page was whatever on the screen that I didn't have
to click to get to (not including menus and dropdown boxes.).

```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- A view a 'slice' of a website that a developer can show or hide w/o refreshing the page.
a view state are the values that need to be retained during postback.
The router manages what gets sent to a client when they change views.

```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?
