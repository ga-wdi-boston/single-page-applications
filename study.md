# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

A single page application is a simplified web app.  It limits the contact with the server by just passing simple request through Json.  It does not require full page reloads/fefresh when it communicates this way.

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

A page is singluar, all content is hosted in on page.  Before I started the reading I think my idea was similar.  However, I now understand the dynamics behind the single page application.


## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

View is the graphical user interface.
I think that the router has something to do with the fact that we might not want to upodate the entire page just specific details.  I became a confused as I read more into states and url's.
View-state has something to do with storing values in an HTML page.  

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

Much more responsive, easier to test the code throughout the build, more organized and less chance for errors by defining code in local scope vs global.

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

Build systems, modules, tooling(npm),
