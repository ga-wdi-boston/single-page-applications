# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
An SPA is a single web page that updates while the user interacts with the page. Normally web pages have to refresh but with SPAs the page will respond using AJAX requests
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Before I had known a page to be what I am currently looking at in the browswer window. It seems like from a developers perspective a page is synonymous with an application in that a page should have all the same functionality as an app that we would use on our phone or computer.

In regards to SPAs, when views take up the entirety of the screen that is referred to as a page.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
Views are sort of like going to other pages. Whenever the client makes changes to the application that changes the view. View state is what is currently happening in the current view. The router is what allows the user to change views while in the browser
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
