# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA is a responsive web app that the user interacts with on one page without changing between pages or reloading
(class)
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
User - when an website's display changes significantly
Me - when you must leave the current page to visit branches (e.g. from home click about us, from about us click locations)
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
view = page
a view state is the condition a page is in (a single page can have multiple conditions e.g. logged in or logged out)
routers load the correct state from within the global states
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
single page applications are dynamic, are more user friendly, and only have to be loaded once but the browser state (back a page, forward a page) may not work
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Ember.js
Meteor.js
AngularJS
```
