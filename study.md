# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
Based on the first reading, a SPA is an app that updates the app's page based on user interactions with the page without having to reload the page.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
When users say page, they generally mean the user interface or the part of the website that they can see and interact with. Before this, I thought of the page as the portion of the website that loads which I could see and interact with. I sometimes also thought of it as the HTML and CSS which make up the website.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
Based on the last article, a view is simply an HTML fragment that make up a screen. A single page app can have multiple views by utilizing various HTML fragments. The view-state is just what a user sees at any given point in time. Front-end routers allows the user to navigate to different view states by selecting and loading the appropriate HTML requested by a user action.>
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Unlike traditional applications, SPAs allows a user to interact with and update the content of a web page without having to refresh the page (frequent page refreshes can hurt the user experience and seem clunky).

In terms of architecture, the first article indicates that it allows for separation between the presentation and application logic.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
AJAX
HTML/CSS/JS
JSON
JS Frameworks (i.e. Angular, Ember etc.)
```
