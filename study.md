# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A SPA short for single page application is either a web app or a website that
fits all in one page, making it easier for the user to use. It doens't need to
refresh and control stays on the same page.

```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md

Users believe page to be what they are looking at when on a website.

"A one page website is simply a single page website that uses only one HTML page.
 When clicking on navigation links, the user scrolls down the page or jumps to
 that particular content's section. The website may use JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3,
 or Ajax to accomplish this movement."

```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
"It can store the page value at the time of post back (Sending and Receiving
information from Server) of your page. ASP.NET pages provide the ViewState
property as a built-in structure for automatically storing values between
multiple requests for the same page."
http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/31344/Beginner-s-Guide-To-View-State

from my understanding I think this would be useful because upon a page refresh
a new game of tic tac toe could be started because the view state would be
cleared.

```
