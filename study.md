# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
SPA is a single page application. It's the idea of retrieving data without having
to refresh a webpage making the page more interactive and responsive.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
The way users interpret a webpage is something along the lines of the pages of a book. When they want to reach different webpages there's usually a link in the
form of text or an image(the link being the singal to turn the page of a book)
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
I think most developers would interpret view as what the usually can actually see
on the browser. I'm not completely sure on this but my interpretation on the view-state refers to the different parts of the page that have
or have not fully rendered. The routers(such as scrolling) is what is used
to navigate between the different view-state
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
Single page applications allow for better user experience. For example logins
are traditionally used as a pop up window rather than being refreshed into a
totally new page.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->
JS, Jquery, Ajax
```
