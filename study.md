# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A web application that will update the a html site on its own. https://johnpapa.net/pageinspa/
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Page is defined users, most of the time, as a website's main or "home" page.
When it refreshes, it's the same page too. That's what I always thought! Now I know
that when it changes, it is a new page.

```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
Pages are formed by views, sort of sections. The view-state is formed by many views, and how it is supposed to be shown to user; how it is structured. Front-end routers
send info from the client to a server (which will show another 'view').
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
An advantage is that SPAs offer a great and 'user-friendly'navigation of the
site because it refreshes the site automatically. Also they avoid 'blocking'
and other issues because it is more responsive.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
Node.js, Angular.js, ASP.NET, Ember.js, specially loaded html, css, and javascript.
```
