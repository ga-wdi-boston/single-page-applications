# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
A Single Page Application is an HTML document that is loaded once on the client side. The document or page does not get reloaded again which allows for more responsive UI/UX. Rather than entire page loads, the page makes requests via AJAX calls and receives responses in JSON format. The presnetation and data layer are discrete and an ideal architecture allows either layer to be modified with minimal impact.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
The page before researching/understanding SPAs is where the content of a site is displayed. For most users what they see as a page are acutally a bunch of views.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
Views are the multiple facets that make up a page. It displays content from models.
A view state is what is displayed at a given moment.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
Advantages of SPAs over traditional web apps consist of:
  1) Modularity
  2) Less reliance on server side depenencies and therefore better responsiveness
  3) Better testability if architected correclty since SPAs encourage modularity
  4) Better scalability for handling multiple components
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
-JS framworks such as Angular, Ember
-Proper usage of JS assets
-HTML
-CSS
-JSON
-AJAX
