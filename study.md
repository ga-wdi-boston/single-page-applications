# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
You have all your files(HTM5, CSS3, JavaScript) load on the page once and
allows functionality without having to reload the page. We do this using Ajax
and JavaScript. This seems to be the best method out there right now.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
It refers to a single webpage it is a shorter term. I understood before my
research that page is refering to a webpage.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
It has to do with how your page looks and a router is going to manage
applications in your view in turn helping it.
```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
A cleaner webpage eliminating the unecessary page reloads, allowing the
user to have a quick input on a wepage.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

```md
Handlebars.js is one of the best methods to use when building Single
Page Application.
```
