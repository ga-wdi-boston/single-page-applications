# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
SPA: Single Page Application. These web applications do not load material but update. the difference is that if it's not SPA then the traditional page has to reload all the time to update the new html file from the server.```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Me before reading the material: a page is a what you see on when you load a website, and if you click on a link then you will see a different page.
Ok, now that i've read the material I can say that a page is the first and only html page a user will recieve from the server to get started and then the client side handles the rest of the UX.```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
I don't have a good grasp on this but I understand that the view is what the page can show. As a SPA, we could see the first page, call that a view, and click on something that pops up another page or article or toggle and call that a view too. I do not know for the the view-state or router though...```

## Define the advantages of an SPA over a traditional application

What are the advantages of a single page application over a traditional appliction?

```md
It is a better UX because the page doesn't have to reload everytime. However, it does mean that the initial server response takes a little longer to load as the html will probably be larger than traditionaly.
```

## List some technologies used to make SPA's

What are some of the tools used to create single page applications?

```md
ajax, curl, js, jquery```
