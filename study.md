# Single-Page Applications Study

Use your favorite search engine to research and answer the following questions
(no prior knowledge is expected). Strive for understanding the definitions
themselves, since you may be asked in an interview to define "single-page
applications" (SPAs) in your own words.

All your projects in this program will be SPAs, so you'll likely internalize
this defintion over time.

It might be a good idea to come back to this later and see if you'd still answer
in the same way! If you have a blog you're using to journal your experience
becoming a web developer, this might make a good article.

## Define "single-page application" (SPA)

In your own words, define what a SPA is. In your answer, be sure to cite any
relevant sources you consulted in your search.

```md
An SPA is a website or web app that loads all needed files on the first page
load, with navigations to other 'pages' essentially just calling for additional
content to be revealed rather than communicating with the server. From that
first pageload, all future content is loaded dynamically.
```

## Define "page" as used by non-developers

What do users mean when they say "page"? What did you mean before your started
your search to define SPAs?

```md
Non-dev users would call a 'page' a distinct section of the site with content
that's differentiated from other 'pages'. As a novice developer, I would've said
a page is an independent call to a server for new content.
```

## Define "view" and "view-state" within the context of SPAs

What do developers mean when they say "view"? Since view can have many meanings,
what do developers mean when they say "view-state"? How do front-end "routers"
help manage view-state?

```md
To developers, the view refers to the portion of the app that is client-facing.
The 'view-state' is the condition of a given view, which may be modified by
the client. Front-end routers take requests from the client and asynchronously
direct them to the server, allowing for modularized parts of the view to be updated
dynamically.
```
